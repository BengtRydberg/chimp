# Tutorial

This tutorial illustrates how to use CHIMP to build a merged precipitation
retrieval based on combined satellite observations from multiple different
platforms.

### The retrieval

This tutorial combines geostationary observations from the GOES-16
satellite with passive-microwave observations from ATMS and GMI to estimate
surface precipitation.
