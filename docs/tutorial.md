# Tutorial

This tutorial illustrates how to use CHIMP to build an integrated precipitation
retrieval combining satellite observations from multiple platforms and sensor
types.

### The retrieval

This tutoral build up a retrieval that uses  geostationary observations from
the GOES-16 satellite combined  passive-microwave observations from ATMS and
GMI to estimate surface precipitation. The retrieval is trained using reference data from ground-based readar measurements from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system and space-borne combined radar-radiometer retrievals from the GPM combined product.
